# trivia-game
Assignment #5, creating an office themed trivia game using javascript and jQuery.

This Assignment was created for UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, using Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.  The game could use some more questions (and maybe some better questions), but at this point is relatively fun.
